    "SKYFAST takes posterior samples produced by a parameter estimation pipeline as input and uses them to reconstruct an analytic joint posterior for right ascension, declination, luminosity distance, and, optionally, the inclination angle of the GW event. The posterior reconstruction is performed using a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM), a Bayesian non-parametric method. \n",
